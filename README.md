# Reptiles-Amphibians-Classifier
Reptiles &amp; Amphibians Classifier built using pre-trained and raw convolutional neural networks with Keras and Tensorflow in Python. All relevant code for the raw model, pre-trained models, and Gradio interface is located in CP468_Project_Code.ipynb. The images used to train, validate, and test each model are located in the new-reptiles-and-amphibians-image-dataset folder. The Pre-trained_Model_Documentation.txt file contains instructions on how to download, configure, train, and test the pre-trained models. For detailed descriptions on how the raw and pre-trained models were constructed, compiled, trained, and tested, please refer to the project report.
